<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

# repDemoproj 

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `repDemoproj` is to demonstrate of a reproducible data analysis project

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
